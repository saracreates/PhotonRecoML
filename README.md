# ECAL with neural networks



## Description

Photons create clusters over multiple cells in the ECAL. To find the x-y-Position and the energy of the inertial photon entering a fiting algorithm is used. This fit doesn't work smoothly with two photons whose clusters overlap. This problem will be approched with a neural network.
